# Password Complexity Checker - Python

This is a simple Python program to **check the strength** of a password based on common complexity rules.

## What is Password Complexity?

Password complexity refers to how difficult a password is to guess or crack. Strong passwords usually contain a mix of:

- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %)
- Minimum length (usually 8 or more characters)

## Features

- Validates password length (minimum 8 characters)
- Checks for at least one uppercase letter
- Checks for at least one lowercase letter
- Checks for at least one digit
- Checks for at least one special character
- Displays clear messages for weak passwords

## How to use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the password when prompted.
3. The program will tell you if the password is strong or weak.
4. If weak, it will mention whatâ€™s missing.

## Example
Enter password: Hello123
Weak password!
Reason: Missing special character

Enter password: Hello@123
Strong password!
